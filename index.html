                <h3>Single Kids Club</h3>
                <p>This is an organization that provides a safe space for students not in relationships to gather and fellowship. This club offers a supportive community where members can share their experiences, find solidarity, and build meaningful friendships. We host regular meetings, social events, and workshops that focus on personal development, mental wellness, and self-love. Our goal is to create a safety net where members can express all the anger and oppression they feel from people in relationships, while also celebrating the joys and benefits of being single. Through open discussions and activities, we strive to foster a sense of belonging and empowerment among our members, reminding them that being single is a valid and fulfilling way of life.</p>
